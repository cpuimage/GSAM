This is unofficial repository for [Towards Efficient and Scalable Sharpness-Aware Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02714) in TensorFlow 2.

Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) is a technique that improves the model generalization and provides robustness to label noise.

[keras's SAM implementation](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/models/sharpness_aware_minimization.py)
