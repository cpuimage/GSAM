# GSAM
This is unofficial repository for [Surrogate Gap Minimization Improves Sharpness-Aware Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08065) in TensorFlow 2.

Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) is a technique that improves the model generalization and provides robustness to label noise.

[google-research's GSAM implementation](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/trainers/proj/gsam/gsam.py)
